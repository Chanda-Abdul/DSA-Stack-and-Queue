## 10. The Ophidian Bank

At the Ophidian Bank, a single teller serves a long queue of people. New customers join the end of the queue, and the teller will serve a customer only if they have all of the appropriate paperwork. Write a representation of this queue; 25% of the time (random), a customer's paperwork isn't quite right, and it's back to the end of the queue. Show what a few minutes of the bank's lobby would look like.

````
function bank(queue) {
  let paperworkisgood = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)
  
  if(paperworkisgood > 25) {
    return queue.dequeue()
  } else {
    let paperworkisbad = queue.dequeue()
    queue.enqueue(paperworkisbad)
    return 'Its actually incomplete, try again later'
  }
}

const oBank = new Queue()

oBank.enqueue(25)
oBank.enqueue(72)
oBank.enqueue(43)
oBank.enqueue(67)
