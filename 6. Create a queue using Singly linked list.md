## 6. Create a queue using Singly linked list

Walk through the Queue class in the curriculum and understand it well.
- Then write a Queue class with its core functions (`enqueue()`, `dequeue()`) from scratch.
````
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = null
    this.last = null
  }
  
  enqueue(data) {
    const node = new _Node(data)
    if(this.first === null) {
      this.first = node
    }
    
    if (this.last) {
      this.last.next = node
    }
    //make the new node the last item on the queue
    this.last = node
  }
  
  dequeue() {
    //if the queue is empty, there is nothing to return
    if (this.fist === null) {
      return
    }
    const node = this.first
    this.first = this.first.next
    //if this is the last item in the queue
    if (node === this.last) {
      this.last = null
    }
    return node.value
  }
}
````
- Create a queue called `starTrekQ` and add `Kirk`, `Spock`, `Uhura`, `Sulu`, and `Checkov` to the queue.
- Implement a `peek()` function outside of the Queue class that lets you take a peek at what the 1st item in the queue is.
- Implement a `isEmpty()` function outside the Queue class that allows you to check if the queue is empty or not
- Implement a `display()` function outside of the Queue class that lets you display what's in the queue.
- Remove `Spock` from the queue and display the resulting queue.
