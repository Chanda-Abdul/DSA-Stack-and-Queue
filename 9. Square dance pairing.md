## 9. Square dance pairing
As people come to the dance floor, they should be paired off as quickly as possible: man with woman, man with woman, all the way down the line. If several men arrive in a row, they should be paired in the order they came, and likewise if several women do. Maintain a queue of "spares" (men for whom you have no women yet, or vice versa), and pair them as appropriate.

- F Jane
- M Frank
- M John
- M Sherlock
- F Madonna
- M David
- M Christopher
- F Beyonce

    - Female dancer is Jane, and the male dancer is Frank
    - Female dancer is Madonna, and the male dancer is John
    - Female dancer is Beyonce, and the male dancer is Sherlock
    - There are 2 male dancers waiting to dance
